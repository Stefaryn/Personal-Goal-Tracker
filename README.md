## goal.py

### Goal Class

contains basic information about goals
-name: a short descriptor of goal
-finish: the benchmark at which the goal is finished
-progress: how much progress has been made

We may want to make the Goal class more abstract and then subclass it more


### GoalList Class

contains a list of Goal objects and methods for saving them.
